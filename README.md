# Illustrating-Regression-Tree-Using-Boston-Housing-Data


  Regression tree is a commonly used method in data mining. Similar to regression analysis, the goal is creating a model to predict the value of a response from several predictors. In this poster, we describe how to generate a regression tree using the decision tree method. This includes how to first build a large tree, how to prune it to find the best sub tree, and how to identify the cost complexity parameter via the cross-validation approach. Then, Regression is employed for the Boston housing data set. I found that the tree indicates the higher percent of lower status of the population, corresponds to less expensive houses.
